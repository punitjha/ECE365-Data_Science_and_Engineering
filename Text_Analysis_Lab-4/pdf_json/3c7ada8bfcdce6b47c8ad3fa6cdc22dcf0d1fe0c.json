            "text": "Background: Hypoxia affects myocardial oxygen supply resulting in subclinical cardiac dysfunction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, with cardiovascular complications being associated with increased oxidative burst (OB). The aims of our study were to assess left ventricular (LV) dynamic myocardial deformation and diastolic reserve at rest and upon exercise, along with OB determination in this patients subset. Methods: Conventional echocardiography, Doppler myocardial imaging and LV 2D speckle tracking echocardiography were performed in 55 OSA patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (EF) and 35 age and sex-comparable healthy controls. Peripheral OB levels were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: Despite comparable LVEF, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly reduced in OSA at rest (\u2212 13.4 \u00b1 3.8 vs \u2212 18.4 \u00b1 3.3 in controls, P < 0.001) and at peak exercise (\u2212 15.8 \u00b1 2.6 vs \u2212 23.4 \u00b1 4.3, P < 0.001). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and E/E\u2032 ratios increase during effort were higher in OSA than in controls (\u0394sPAP 44.3% \u00b1 6.4 vs 32.3% \u00b1 5.5, P < 0.0001, and \u0394E/E' 87.5% \u00b1 3.5 vs 25.4% \u00b1 3.3, P < 0.0001, respectively). The best correlate of E/E\u2032 at peak stress was peak exertion capacity (r = \u2212 0.50, P < 0.001). OB was also increased in OSA patients (P = 0.001) but, unlike OSA severity, was not associated with LV diastolic dysfunction. Conclusions: Evaluation of diastolic function and myocardial deformation during exercise is feasible through stress echocardiography. OSA patients with preserved LVEF show subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, impaired LV systolic and diastolic reserve, reduced exercise tolerance, and increased peripheral levels of OB. Therapy aimed at increasing LV diastolic function reserve might improve the quality of life and exercise tolerability in OSA patients.",

OSA is an increasing health problem, often associated with cardiovascular disorders, including left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias [2, 3] . Repetitive hypoxia episodes adversely affect the interaction between myocardial oxygen demand and supply, with development of subclinical systolic dysfunction [4] . Furthermore, hormonal and metabolic dysregulation, oxidative burst (OB), systemic inflammation and mechanical hemodynamic disturbances lead to LV remodeling and diastolic dysfunction [5] [6] [7] [8] . There is evidence of a consistent relationship between OB and OSA [9] . OB has been suggested as a marker of upper airway obstructive episodes and hypoxemia causing local oropharyngeal inflammation [10] , and has been associated with cardiovascular complications [11, 12] .",

All measurements were performed at our Cardiology Unit and independently assessed by two cardiologists expert in echocardiography, according to current recommendations [20] [21] [22] . Rest echocardiography: LV ejection fraction (EF) and LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) were evaluated as systolic function indexes. LVEF was calculated using the Simpson biplane method, from the apical 4-and 2-chamber views. A biplane LVEF \u226552% for men and \u2265 54% for women were considered normal [20] . For strain calculation, the endocardial borders of the LV myocardial walls were traced by a point-and-click approach, in the end-systolic frame of the 2D images, from the apical 3-, 4-, and 2-chamber views. The tracking algorithm followed the endocardium during all the cardiac cycle. Basal, mid, and apical regions of interest were created and segments that failed to track were manually adjusted. Longitudinal strains for each of 18 segments were measured and LV GLS was calculated as the mean strain of all the segments. The tracking process and conversion to Lagrangian strains were performed offline using dedicated software (EchoPAC PC 2D strain, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). We defined impaired GLS as > \u2212 20% (a less negative value reflects a more impaired GLS) [20, 21] . The following diastolic function parameters were measured by pulsed wave (PW) Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), in apical 4chamber view: peak early (E) and late (A) diastolic velocity of the mitral inflow, E/A ratio, peak septal and lateral early myocardial diastolic velocity (e\u2032) and average E/e\u2032 ratio. The peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) was measured in multiple echocardiographic windows. On the basis of the highest TRV obtained, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was calculated through the Bernoulli's principle: (4xTRV 2 ) + right atrial pressure (RAP). RAP was estimated by measuring the diameter of the inferior vena cava and its respiratory motion. Left atrial volume index (LAVI) was assessed through biplane area-length method, dividing the left atrial volume by the body surface area (BSA). Atrium acquisitions were made from the apical 4-and 2-chamber views. The presence of more than 2 between average E/e' > 14, septal e' < 7 cm/s or lateral e' < 10 cm/s, TRV > 2.8 m/s (sPAP> 36 mmHg), and LAVI > 34 ml/m 2 , was considered expression of LV diastolic dysfunction in subjects with normal LVEF [22] . Exercise stress echocardiography: Standard supine bicycle exercise stress echocardiography was performed with incremental steps of 25 W every 2 min [23] .

The relationship between OSA and LV systolic dysfunction is not surprising as OSA patients experience repeated increases in LV after-load during sleep, due to exaggerated negative intra-thoracic pressure and intermittent hypoxia and arousals. Acute repeated increases in after-load can therefore result in LV subclinical systolic dysfunction [29] . In this study, we enrolled patients with moderate-severe OSA and healthy controls with preserved LVEF and found an early involvement of the LV myocardium in the former. Actually, despite LVEF, that is traditionally used as systolic function parameter, was normal in OSA patients, we found an impaired basal LV GLS, which is expression of subclinical LV pump dysfunction. In addition, we also found that strain increase during physical exercise in OSA patients was lower if compared to healthy controls, reflecting their low contractile reserve. Interestingly, we previously detected that OSA patients have also a subclinical RV dysfunction, and that RV GLS impairment was associated with sPAP and disease severity [30] . Previous studies show that the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction at rest among OSA patients varies from 23 to 56%, depending on the sample size and the method of diastolic function assessment [31] [32] [33] [34] . In our cohort we observed that, according to recent guidelines [22] , a definite diastolic dysfunction was present in the 34.5% of OSA patients at rest. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LV diastolic dysfunction in OSA have been widely studied: repetitive hypoxemia/re-oxygenation sequences, sympathetic bursts, renin-angiotensinaldosterone system activation, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, intra-thoracic pressure reduction and trans-mural pressure increasing, all participate in the development of LV hypertrophy and remodelling, and hence of LV diastolic dysfunction [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "To our knowledge this is the first study addressing the LV diastolic performance both at rest and at peak exercise in a selected population of OSA patients. In middle-aged healthy subjects, the E/e\u2032 ratio does not change significantly with exercise because of proportional increases in both the mitral inflow and annular velocities [35] [36] [37] [38] . Conversely, in our series almost all patients enrolled showed an increase of the E/e' ratio, that was significantly higher than in the control group. This finding indicates an impairment of the LV diastolic function reserve resulting in an increased LV filling pressure during exercise [22, 39, 40] . In agreement with these observations, also sPAP increase was significantly higher in OSA than in healthy subjects. The mean sPAP value in OSA patients was > 43 mmHg (as estimated by a TRV > 3.1 m/s), which is the echocardiography threshold of abnormal diastolic stress according to international guidelines [23] . The present study clearly underlines the strong relation between E/e' ratio and exercise tolerance in OSA. Patients with a higher E/e' ratio at peak exercise, and hence a more impaired diastolic reserve, showed a reduced functional capacity highlighted by a lower maximal workload and a reduced peak SpO 2 level. The E/e' ratio at peak exercise also resulted significantly correlated to LV GLS, to AHI, which reflects OSA severity, and to blood lactates, which are suggestive of inadequate tissue perfusion. These findings can be explained by the mentioned pathological mechanisms responsible for myocardial remodelling and fibrosis. The latter provokes impairment in both systolic and diastolic function, which can worsen during exercise, leading to reduced functional capacity.",

First, it is a single-centre study with a sample size too small to drive definitive general conclusions concerning subclinical LV functional impairment in OSA patients. Also, our findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated to patients with mild disease. Finally, despite we found no correlations between the diastolic impairment during exercise and patients age, OB, BMI, smoking and co-morbidities, we cannot definitely exclude their contribution. Indeed, while we excluded OSA patients with major heart and lung diseases, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoke, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, was still not negligible in our patient cohort. Further studies in larger populations will certainly help to address their impact by ad hoc sub-group analyses.",
