            "text": "In order to monitor progress towards malaria elimination, it is crucial to be able to measure changes in spatio-temporal transmission. However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p>0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p>0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020.

However, in order to monitor progress towards elimination and plan interventions, it is crucial to measure malaria transmission and how it varies over space and time. However, traditional metrics used to measure malaria transmission are not suitable in elimination settings. China is one example of a country approaching elimination, with aims to eliminate the disease by 2020. Using a detailed individual level dataset of the times and locations of people showing symptoms of malaria, we use approaches adapted from the study of how information spreads through social networks to estimate the likelihood of transmission occurring between cases. This information is used to estimate how many people we expect each case to go on to infect. In elimination settings, this number is an indication of how quickly elimination will be reached and how likely we are to see a resurgence in cases once elimination is achieved. Our results show a decline in this metric over time, as well as seasonal changes in transmission which are different to the patterns in when the most cases were observed.",

            "text": "Introduction the World Health Organisation listed 21 countries for whom it would be realistic to achieve elimination of malaria by 2020, defined as zero indigenous cases over three consecutive years [1] . The largest of these is the People's Republic of China (thereafter called China). In 2017 China reported no indigenous malaria cases for the first time since malaria became a notifiable disease in 1956 [2, 3] . The country has experienced a major decline in the burden of malaria, from an annual incidence of 24 million cases (2961 cases per 100,000) in 1970 [4] . This reduction has been attributed to a combination of socioeconomic improvements and the scale-up of interventions to control malaria [5] . In 2010, China set out an ambitious plan for the national elimination of malaria by 2020 (the National Malaria Elimination Programme, NMEP). Elements of the plan included improved surveillance, timely response, more effective and sensitive risk assessment tools and improved diagnostics [6] . A key policy change implemented in 2010 as part of the NMEP was the introduction of the 1-3-7 system: aiming for case reporting in one day, which is then investigated within three days, with a focused investigation and action taken in under seven days [7] .",

Concerns remain about re-emergence of malaria, which has occurred several times in the early 2000s as a result of importation and favourable climatic conditions for competent vectors [11] .

The province shares borders with Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos and has a strong agricultural focus. Previous studies suggest that seasonal agricultural workers and farmers are at highest risk of contracting malaria in Yunnan, with rice yield and the proportion of rural employees being spatial factors positively associated with malaria incidence [17] . The border region of Myanmar and Yunnan is generally ecologically suitable for malaria transmission, has a large mobile population, with few natural geographic borders separating the two countries, as well as being a site of sociopolitical conflict and instability [18] . In this context, it can be unclear if there is any sustained local transmission or if all the observed cases are the result of short, stuttering transmission chains following importation into suitable areas. As the area of highest concern for re-emergence in China and the last to reach zero cases, we therefore sought to characterise the transmission dynamics of both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in the region as China approaches elimination certification.",

However due to the strength of the surveillance system in China, detailed information is available about each individual case (including the time of symptom onset and location of residence), and case reporting is believed to be very high. By adapting and applying a diffusion network approach [22] within a Bayesian framework, we quantify case reproduction numbers [23] , R c , and uncertainty in these estimates for all P. vivax and P. falciparum cases of malaria recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016.

Our results suggest that transmission in this province decreased rapidly between 2011 and 2016 as shown by a declining risk of R c exceeding zero across the province.

However, as all data analysed was collected whilst the NMEP was in place, we cannot draw conclusions about the impact of scaling back interventions or consider other counterfactuals. There is also some uncertainty in our estimates of current and future R c , although the 95% credible intervals of these estimates remain below 1. It is important to note that even with low R c values it is still possible for locally-acquired cases to occur following importation, however the probability of sustained chains of transmission decreases as R c decreases. There also is more uncertainty in our estimates of risk in areas that have not observed many cases. It is difficult to determine whether an absence of cases is due to a lack of detection, a lack of importation events occurring or a low underlying receptivity to transmission. However, it is worth noting that the greatest uncertainty in our spatiotemporal risk estimates of R c >0 tends to be in areas of high elevation (elevation > 3000m), where there is unlikely to be transmission. Given the large numbers of imported cases, it is important to highlight these uncertainties and ensure control measures are maintained. Nonetheless, our findings are promising for China to meet their 2020 elimination goal. Our results highlight the success the country has had in malaria control and highlights the difficulty of elimination certification in contexts where both distant and local cross border importation is common.",

This is interesting to note, as the March/April increase in R c would be expected to occur prior to an increase in incidence, however the second apparent peak in R c is not reflected by an increase in incidence in the months following. This pattern could be an artefact of human movement, with both periods associated with seasonal movement and holiday periods-the Chunyun period occurs in China for Chinese New Year and the holiday week of the National Day in October and is associated with intranational travel to visit family. During this time, there is often movement from cities to rural areas, and so in these contexts there may be more opportunities for infection to occur as more people are exposed to bites from suitable vectors. This is supplemented by our finding that these specific holidays are associated with small to moderate increases in R c , however it is worth noting the very wide credible intervals and the great deal of uncertainty associated with these estimates, and therefore caution is required when interpreting this finding.",

This definition might include people who travelled abroad within the week prior to illness onset, but biologically their infection could not have been obtained during that time given the incubation period. However, in the absence of alternative information, travel history may provide a better indication of the likely importation status of a case than attempting to infer importation without this information, however there could be scope in future work to allow for incorrect travel history. As certification of elimination is now tolerant of introduced (first generation imported-to-local transmission) but not indigenous (second generation local-to-local transmission) cases, being able to differentiate between the two, and understanding how much transmission is indigenous versus imported or introduced is an important area of focus for future work.",

According to China CDC, Yunnan has achieved full coverage of basic healthcare at village/community level, and local residents and migrants can easily and timely access to health services. Following the National Malaria Elimination Action Plan, hospitals/CDCs provide free antimalarials to cure both local and imported malaria cases found in Chinese residents, mobile populations or foreigners, and pharmacies and non-medical institutions cannot sell antimalarials. Additionally, since China launched the Malaria Elimination Action Plan in 2010, Yunnan Province has special fund to support enhanced malaria surveillance with a high sensitivity, as it was identified as a key province with endemic malaria. The healthcare units at township level are required to screen malaria in febrile patients, so that the possibility of missed diagnosis or underreports of malaria in the patients with fever is likely to be low. Due to the low levels of malaria in China, immunity is likely to be low and therefore asyptomatic infection is less likely. For those who do have no fever or mild symptoms, we assume they have limited capacity to transmit malaria as their gametocyte density is likely to be low. Given the low levels of asymptomatic parasitaemia one would expect in this context, it is unlikely that these infections are contributing much to ongoing infection and therefore affecting our estimates, especially as we do estimate and allow for unobserved sources of infection in our approach.",

According to China's National Malaria Elimination Technology Program (2011), the epidemiological history of each case has been investigated to check the source of the infection and the history of previous infection and relapse malaria. The individual-based data recorded electronically allow us to compare and find out the relapse malaria, but no relapse cases were found during the study. In addition, all malaria cases received free antimalarial treatment, and each case of P. vivax malaria was treated for radical cure. Nonetheless, there is still a small chance of some relapse cases. In our approach we jointly estimate unobserved sources of infection but are agnostic as to the specific cause of the unobserved source, relapses are considered as one of the potential unobserved sources of infection. Although large amounts of relapse are unlikely for the reasons outlined above, if there were very large amounts of relapse, the estimated reproduction numbers could be over-estimated. However, given we find such low reproduction numbers, even if this unlikely situation were the case, this does not impact our key findings and in fact would be stronger evidence of China achieving large reductions in malaria transmission between 2011 and 2016.",

Firstly, methods to make use of contact tracing data have been developed for emerging outbreaks [25] but have not to our knowledge been applied to endemic disease in the elimination. Although contact tracing for indirectly transmitted diseases is more difficult, identifying if the likely source of infection is a breeding site near the home or a place of work is carried out through active case detection schemes, but often the resulting data are not made available alongside line list data. This information could be used to weight certain connections. Genetic data are also increasingly available, and provide useful information about movement of parasites [26, 27] , the likelihood of two cases being linked by transmission, and can provide useful information to help distinguish imported from local cases and chains of transmission resulting from importation from on-going local transmission [21] . Such data were not available in this context; however, a similar methodological framework or approach could incorporate information such as genetic distance. Historical data on incidence at fine scale (e.g. village level) could also be used to inform likelihood of asymptomatic infection.",

We predict a mean R c of 0.005 up to 2020, however even with such low R c values estimated, there may still be a need to continue to invest in detecting and rapidly responding to imported cases in order to achieve three consecutive years of zero cases and prevent resurgence.

The serial interval distribution of treated, symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, previously characterised using empirical and model based evidence [30, 31] was adapted to inform the prior distribution for the relationship between time and likelihood of transmission between cases in China. We analysed P. vivax cases and P. falciparum cases separately. The prior distribution was defined to be flexible enough to reflect both the biology of P. vivax and P. falciparum as well as the dominant vector species in Yunnan (recent surveys in Yunnan province have found Anopheles sinensis to be the dominant vector species in mid-elevation areas and rice paddies and Anopheles minimus s.l. the dominant species in low elevation areas [13, 32] and to allow for possible variation in transmission dynamics, for example due to untyped infections or delays in seeking treatment. In addition, there is a possibility of a small number of asymptomatic or undetected and therefore untreated infections contributing to ongoing transmission, which will typically have a longer serial interval. We use a shifted Rayleigh distribution (a special case of a Weibull distribution), to describe the serial interval of both species, which can be varied by changing two parameters: \u03b1 and \u03b3. The parameter \u03b1 governs the overall shape of the distribution, and \u03b3 is the shifting parameter accounting for the incubation period between receiving an infectious bite and the onset of symptoms (Fig 1A) . The \u03b3 shifting parameter was fixed at 15 days to account for the extrinsic incubation period within the mosquito and the minimum time between infection and suitable numbers of gametocytes in the blood to lead to symptom onset [33] . The prior for the \u03b1 parameter determining the shape of the distribution was given a Normal distribution with mean 0.003 and standard deviation 0.1 (illustrated in Fig 5) , giving an expected time between symptom onset of one case and symptom onset of the case it infects of 36 days, with the parameter value in the 2.5 percentile of prior having an expected serial interval of 21 days and the equivalent parameter from the 97.5 percentile having an expected serial interval of 60 days. By comparison the expected values for treated P. falciparum from existing literature range between 33 and 49.1 days (95% CI = 33-69) [30, 31] . Depending on how much uncertainty there is in the serial interval (SI) of malaria, the prior for \u03b1, the shaping parameter for the SI of malaria, may be varied. We explored the effects of different priors on the likelihood and posterior estimates. We used the same mean value for \u03b1 (0.003) but set the \u03b1 prior to standard deviation between 1 and 0.01. The results of considering different priors for \u03b1, the parameter shaping SI distribution on estimated R c values over time is shown in S2 Fig. ",
