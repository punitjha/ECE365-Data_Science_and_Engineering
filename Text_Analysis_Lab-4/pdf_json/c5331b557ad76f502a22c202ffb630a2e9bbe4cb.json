Based on our study of an emergency department that was disrupted by the threat of the Ebola virus in 2014, we develop a process model to explain how a place of social inclusion can be maintained by custodians. We show how these custodians-in our fieldsite, doctors and nurses-experience and engage in institutional work to manage different levels of tension between the value of inclusion and the reality of finite resources, as well as tension between inclusion and the desire for safety. We also demonstrate how the interplay of custodians' emotions is integral to maintaining the place of social inclusion. The primary contribution of our study is to shine light on places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society. We also reveal the theoretical and practical importance of places as institutions, deepen understanding of custodians and custodianship as a form of institutional work, and offer new insight into the dynamic processes that connect emotions and institutional work.",

Building on this literature, Carr et al. (1992) focused specifically on the importance of public placesthose designed and built to provide universal accessibility for all citizens to essential human services-and proposed that such places are where citizens go to make ''claims'' for access to services. The literature on institutional theory in organizational studies, in contrast, has so far engaged only minimally with the concept of place, primarily considering place as merely the research setting (Lawrence and Dover, 2015) . Yet because an institutional approach inherently draws attention to the role of institutions in bringing order, stability, and meaning to society (Scott, 2014) , there are obvious synergies in combining aspects of institutional theory with the concept of place.",

            "text": "In developing our concept of a place of social inclusion as an important institution of the democratic state, we focus attention on how the combination of place and institution produces precariousness. Early institutional scholars cautioned that institutions' values are inherently precarious because their existence at the macro level of society depends on organizations and individuals reproducing them at the micro level in actions and interactions (Selznick, 1957 (Selznick, , 1992 . In considering a place of social inclusion as an institution, we draw on the place literature to suggest that the institution's precariousness is inherent in the local character of places and place claiming (Carr et al., 1992; Gieryn, 2000) . By this we mean the societal-level value of providing universal accessibility to essential services for all citizens is precarious because it must be continuously accomplished at the local level each time a citizen makes a claim for services from a specific geographically bounded site in a neighborhood, town, or city. At the local level, the accessibility of any particular site that is a place of social inclusion-for example, a local emergency department or public school-may be affected by factors such as population growth, income inequalities, natural disasters, and social ills like poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, and poor physical and mental health. Gun shootings occur in local schools, terrorists attack citizens in public open places, crime and violence assail neighborhoods, and pandemics and infectious diseases spread across national borders and within local communities, as the 2020 pandemic of coronavirus disease showed while we were finalizing this research. We posit that places of social inclusion are constituted as universally accessible institutions of the democratic state, yet the perpetuation of these institutions is consistently challenged by such ongoing threats. How, then, are places of social inclusion maintained?",

The Australian government establishes and supports public emergency departments in local places to offer all citizens access to care and treatment for their acute health needs. By undertaking observations and interviews at our emergency department fieldsite, we were able to examine the everyday struggles involved in accomplishing the societal-level value of social inclusion through universal access to medical care at a local place. The precariousness of the emergency department as a place of social inclusion was cast into bold relief when our fieldwork was punctuated by the Ebola outbreak in 2014, offering a unique opportunity to explore and understand both the ordinary and extraordinary efforts needed to maintain places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society.",

Scott (2014: 56) defined institutions as comprising ''regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive elements that, together with associated activities and resources, provide stability and meaning to social life.'' While institutional scholars have rarely postulated meaningful relationships between places and institutions (see Lawrence and Dover, 2015 , for an exception), Scott's (2014) definition implies that a place should be conceptualized as an institution. A place is regulated by laws, rules, and codes of conduct that seek to control and order how people interact with and in that place. A place is supported normatively by values and beliefs that define what inhabitants should strive to attain and how. Finally, a place will evoke shared meanings and ''a way of seeing, knowing and understanding the world'' that is cognitively and affectively accepted by people who inhabit that place (Cresswell, 2014: 11) . Moreover, because institutions are multi-level systems, both a higher-order place like the world system and a local place like a county fair can be institutions (Barley, 2008) . The world is ''filled with significant places'' (Relph, 1976 : 1) that are institutions and that are intrinsic to the constitution and reproduction of social life (Giddens, 1984) . In this paper, we draw attention to the institution of a place of social inclusion.",

This institution is instantiated in local geographic sites that are publicly accessible to citizens with specified human needs and are infused with meaning and values associated with normative social purpose. Established theory about public places focuses on the importance of being situated locally in neighborhoods, towns, cities, states, and nations (Francis et al., 2012; Parkinson, 2012) . Because places are geographically bounded by their natural and physical location and the buildings and material objects assembled there (Gieryn, 2000) , the physicality of places affects the way in which they are resourced to accomplish normative social purposes. Although previous literature on public places has not stressed the characteristic of social inclusiveness, to varying degrees it is inherent to discussions of public access to places such as emergency departments, public schools, libraries, recreational parks, welfare offices, community centers, and courts of law.",

The societal level captures the regulative and cultural-cognitive elements of a place of social inclusion in the democratic state and the normative values it is expected to accomplish for citizens through meeting specific needs. Depending on the precise nature of these needs, places of social inclusion are embedded in the state and also intersect with other higher-order institutions in society such as the medical, teaching, and legal professions. The local level reflects the specificity of the geographic places in which the institutional values of a place of social inclusion are accomplished. That is, human needs are met at local sites-such as a local emergency department or public school-that are resourced by the state to actualize the institutional value of social inclusion. Because places at the local level are ''forever precarious and contested'' when they nest within societal-level systems (Gieryn, 2000: 472) , a place of social institution is an inherently precarious type of institution.",

Geographers and sociologists pursue one stream, focusing on how people interact with a place (Relph, 1976; Lewicka, 2011) . This literature posits a reciprocal relationship between people and place (Kaufman and Kaliner, 2011) . Places are created, reproduced, and transformed by the human activities and social relations that transpire in a particular locale, as people experience and interpret the place's historically contingent meanings, values, routines, and resources (Tuan, 1977; Agnew, 1987) . Cognitions and emotions shape how people interact with each other and with the material aspects of place (Scannell and Gifford, 2010) . This literature conceptualizes a person who visits a public place to access its material and symbolic resources as ''making a claim'' on the place (Carr et al., 1992) . The staff of the public place must respond by ''strik[ing] the right balance among various claims on its use and meaning'' (Carr et al., 1992: 20) and ensuring ''place claims are . . . being noticed and taken seriously'' (Parkinson, 2012: 1) . However, the everyday cycle of claim-making and responding is not well understood (Patterson and Williams, 2005; Molotch, 2011) . Researchers know little about the behavioral routines that maintain the rhythm of life of a place and how they shape people's experiences of material resources and their enduring sense of place (Stedman, 2003) .",

Lawrence and Suddaby (2006: 230) defined the work of maintaining institutions as ''supporting, repairing, or recreating the social mechanisms that ensure compliance.'' Implicit in most studies is an assumption that place is just the site where actors perform institutional work directed at other institutions. Researchers have highlighted how the Cambridge University dining hall (Dacin, Munir, and Tracey, 2010) and English County Cricket grounds (Wright and Zammuto, 2013) offer settings where actors perform institutional work that (re)produces institutions of social class. Nazi concentration camps have been viewed as settings where institutional work creating social oppression was undertaken (Marti and Fernandez, 2013) . Institutional work maintaining professional occupations goes on in museums, law courts, restaurants, and hospitals through the everyday actions of curators (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018) , lawyers and advocates (McPherson and Sauder, 2013; Siebert, Wilson, and Hamilton, 2017) , chefs (Gill and Burrow, 2018) , and physicians and nurses (Reay, Golden-Biddle, and GermAnn, 2006; Kellogg, 2009; Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017) . Place was not the focus in the aforementioned studies, but Lawrence and Dover (2015) have drawn attention to how place influences institutional work, showing how places serve as ''social enclosures'' that contain, ''signifiers'' that mediate, and ''practical objects'' that complicate institutional work. We draw inferences from the established literature to suggest three tentative insights into how the institutional work associated with maintaining a place of social inclusion might play out.",

Selznick (1957: 94) argued that societal values are protected by institutional ''guardians'': professionals working inside formal organizations who are entrusted with institutional values and given autonomy to defend them from subversion by other goals. While some scholars have applied Selznick's concept of guardians (Kraatz, Ventresca, and Deng, 2010; Kraatz and Flores, 2015) , others have invoked Soares' (1997) term ''custodian'' to designate the caretakers of values, traditions, and institutionalized practices (Dacin, Dacin, and Kent, 2019) . For Soares (1997: 14-15) , custodians are ''practitioners who have a sense of community . . . [and] a sense of custodianship for the tradition's present and future prospects.'' Howard-Grenville and colleagues (2013: 119) used the term ''custodians'' to label community members who ''actively and tenaciously conserved and protected the [place] identity'' of TrackTown USA. Taken together, these studies suggest that places of social inclusion may be maintained by custodians.",

Other studies have shown that moral emotions-which the psychology literature links to the interests and welfare of society (Haidt, 2003) -motivate reflective action to maintain, protect, and defend institutional values and practices (Fan and Zietsma, 2017; Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017) .

Actions associated with maintenance may not always be obvious because the custodians who inhabit institutions are engaged in the usual day-to-day affairs of their workplace (Hallett and Ventresca, 2006; Fine and Hallett, 2014) . Maintenance work may be ''nearly invisible and often mundane'' (Lawrence, Suddaby, and Leca, 2009 : 1) when custodians support an institution by complying with regulations, enacting normative routines, and performing rituals (Lawrence and Suddaby, 2006; Dacin, Munir, and Tracey, 2010) . Although these actions are institutionally conditioned, custodians are still able to engage in low-level intentional action by making small-scale incremental choices between sets of institutionalized practices and routines (Battilana and D#Aunno, 2009 ). However, because breakdowns in institutionalized practices are inevitable, ''active and intentional custodial work may be [necessary] for the continued stability of most institutions'' (Lok and de Rond, 2013: 187) . More intentional maintenance work involves self-conscious action and reflection by custodians (Battilana and D#Aunno, 2009) , as well as deliberate efforts to resist change and to defend and repair an institution whose survival is threatened (Kellogg, 2009; Currie et al., 2012) .",

EDs are staffed 24 hours a day to provide urgent medical attention to people in need (Coget and Keller, 2010) , and citizens with acute illnesses or injuries go to these universally accessible sites to receive treatment from emergency physicians and nurses (Kellermann, 2006; Wright et. al., 2016) .

Patients were assigned to a category on the Australasian Triage Scale and streamed by the triage nurse as follows: (1) patients suffering imminently life-and limb-threatening conditions-such as a heart attack, stroke, or major trauma-were streamed to a ''Resuscitation Zone'' with advanced equipment and beds; (2) patients with urgent, semi-urgent, and non-urgent needs were streamed to an ''Acute Zone'' of examination bed cubicles with basic equipment; and (3) patients whose condition could be treated rapidly and discharged, such as minor lacerations and fractures, were streamed to a ''Fast Track Zone.'' About 80 percent of emergency patients were able to be treated and discharged, while the remaining 20 percent were judged to be sufficiently unwell to require hospital admission.",

We collected a total of 210 hours of observational data over a six-month period, with observations recorded as handwritten fieldnotes and typed up after each shift. These observational data were supplemented with 47 interviews with senior emergency physicians who oversaw the everyday work of the ED: 15 senior emergency physicians were interviewed twice, and 17 were interviewed on a single occasion. Interviews were semistructured, with questions designed to elicit accounts of the emergency physician's work as a custodian of the ED as a place of social inclusion. Interviews lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and were digitally recorded and transcribed. We also interviewed nine residents who were undergoing specialty training in emergency medicine and 29 nurses about their experiences in the ED, with these interviews typically lasting 30 minutes. Four additional interviews, lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were conducted with hospital executives, and we attended a number of staff meetings, training sessions, and strategic planning days.

We used NVivo 9 and Excel software to assist with coding. Our initial focus was the observational fieldnotes, which captured in real time the day-to-day activities of doctors and nurses responding to persons who presented to the ED. Consistent with the place literature (Carr et al., 1992; Parkinson, 2012) , we conceptualized each presentation as a ''claim'' made on the ''place-specific resources'' of the fieldsite ED and viewed doctors and nurses as the ''custodians'' tasked with allocating resources to satisfy claims. As we read our fieldnotes, we were struck by the consistent responses of doctors and nurses regarding their responsibility to ensure the ED remained accessible to all citizens. As part of their approach to providing services, we noticed that as they evaluated cues about each claim, doctors and nurses experienced different levels of tension between the ED being an inclusive place for everyone and having sufficient resources at the local place to respond adequately to all claims. 1 We observed that doctors and nurses served as custodians of resources through two types of work when responding to a claim. The first type was activated when doctors and nurses experienced a low level of tension between inclusion and resources and interpreted the basis for a person's claim as an immediate or recurrent health need. Here, we noticed that doctors and nurses tended to feel emotions of low intensity. After consulting the literature (Hoffman, 2000; Haidt, 2003) , we categorized these feelings as moral emotions because the custodians expressed a desire to ''do the right thing'' for the patient and for society when allocating resources to the claim. We labeled this custodianship as resource-rationing work.",

The jolt from the Ebola crisis gave us the opportunity to investigate a second tension that arises when safety of the local place conflicts with social inclusion.

Interviewees described how they were ''used to'' dealing with physical harm from persons who were behaving violently and with the infection risk of ''well-known'' transmissible diseases. Consulting the literature for guidance, we speculated that Ebola confronted custodians with a decision situation reminiscent of ''Knightian uncertainty,'' when prediction of future outcomes is impossible. (Knight, 1921) . In contrast, claims associated with other threats of harm presented decision situations involving ''risk,'' when possible future outcomes are known and probabilities can be attached. The literature also offered guidance on the differences between fear-a basic emotion that is immediately felt and triggers individual self-defense responses (Ekman, 1992) -and the higher-order and more reflective moral emotions that we had noticed custodians experiencing toward the inclusion-resource tension. We sensed that being able to manage fear by mitigating risk was fundamental to custodian work that maintained the ED as a place of social inclusion in the face of the inclusion-safety tension.",

As one doctor put it, ''The public hospital ED is the ultimate environment . . . [where] it's a privilege to provide a service to everybody'' (D38). 2 In contrast to the pay-for-service ED in private hospitals, the public ED is a place of social inclusion where ''everyone is equal'' (N6) and ''everybody deserves the same sort of entitlements and rights as everybody else'' (D41). For Australian people in marginalized and vulnerable groups-such as the homeless, mentally ill, drug or alcohol addicted, and socially disadvantaged-the public ED is often ''the one place where these guys can get looked after'' (D31). Public EDs in Australia ''are the safety net for vulnerable people . . . whatever's going on [in society] we become that place'' (D21). At the same time, there is broad recognition that public EDs provide care that is not only socially inclusive but of high quality. A hospital executive at our fieldsite ED said, ''If I was really sick I would like to be in here, which is always the test!'' (M4).",

As a local place of social inclusion, the ED is expected to be ''the saving place for so many people who come [here to make claims] for all sorts of reasons'' (D1). Yet the data indicate that the combination of societal institution and local place has consequences that make this accomplishment difficult. The ED is geographically and materially bounded because the government has assembled a finite stock of resourcesstaffing, beds, equipment, diagnostic technologies, and other supplies-at the local place to respond to citizens' claims. This creates a tension between the institutional value of inclusion and local resources. A nurse described this value tension: ''Everyone is entitled to health care, but you've only got this much resource and you've got this [gestures with hands to indicate volume of people presenting to the local ED]-how do you match them?'' (N6). A second value tension concerns local safety. At the societal level, the ED as a place of social inclusion ''should at least be a safe place to come'' (fieldnotes). But our data show that translating this value at the local level into ''an open door policy to members of the public'' (fieldnotes) exposes the fieldsite ED to risks of harm arising from infectious diseases and acts of violence.",

Nurse N inserts a drip and takes blood samples. Senior doctor, Dr S, notices that P ''looks pretty sick,'' examines P, and prescribes anti-nausea medication. N offers comforting words, and Dr S orders a CT scan to check for an obstruction. A radiologist suggests using a contrast dye with the CT scan, but this means P will need a bed for longer, and Dr S is not convinced the dye is medically warranted. After the scan, Dr S moves P to the ED's short stay unit for 24 hours with a plan that if the vomiting and pain settle down, P will be discharged and given a follow-up appointment with a hospital outpatient clinic. If symptoms persist, P will be reviewed by surgeons for an operation. (Fieldnotes) This example illustrates how custodian work occurs through resource rationing. The doctor and nurse evaluate the basis for the claim as an immediate health need. Perceiving that the ED has adequate resources to resolve this need, they experience low tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and the local ED's finite resources. They allocate appropriate, but not excessive, resources and emotional energy to meet the need underlying the claim (staff time and expertise, investigation, equipment, 24-hour bed, empathy), which maximizes the ED's ability to respond to other claims. Had this been a pay-for-service private ED rather than a place of social inclusion, the doctor would not have had to think about how ''ordering a CT scan may delay another CT scan for another patient-you have a different [responsibility]'' (D44). A doctor who worked in both the fieldsite ED and a private ED explained, ''I will make different decisions on what I do in the public sector and private sector because I know there is different access and availability in the . . . resources'' (D34). Table 2 presents examples of these microprocesses in which custodians apprehend a claim as an immediate or recurrent health need, experience low tension between social inclusion and finite resources, and meet the need by rationing resources. Examples of claims for immediate needs included new symptoms that a person was experiencing such as back pain, acute exacerbations of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, and diagnostic puzzles such as multiple sclerosis. Claims for recurrent needs involved the repetition of a past illness or behavior, such as unchanged chronic illness or frequent attendance for non-emergency claims. Doctors and nurses responded to claims for recurrent needs by allocating ''the bare minimum'' (D20) resources because they were ''obliged to sort out [the claim] enough to allow the patient to go home in some sort of safe and dignified manner'' (D22). When a patient's needs can be adequately met with the usual attention to rationing resources, custodian work involves moral emotions of low intensity because custodians ''feel comfortable about how they can deliver care within those constraints'' (M2).",

According to our informants who have comparable experiences of working in pay-for-service EDs in private hospitals and in other departments in public hospitals, this process of resource rationing is distinctive to their custodian role at the fieldsite ED. Participants reflected that resource-rationing work is ''a different reality'' (D33) for medical and nursing professionals employed in a public ED because no other place of medicine in Australia has responsibility for accomplishing the value of universal accessibility to medical care. That is, Australian citizens ''know that the emergency department never shuts and know that the ED is never going to turn us away'' (D21). EDs in private hospitals, which are ''essentially business'' (D29), do not have this responsibility. Nor do other departments in public hospitals because they are not ''the initial point of contact for people coming from outside'' (R8). When working in those departments, participants said, ''You're not thinking about the limited resource'' (D32) in the same way as in the ED.

Sometimes custodians made judgments that a claimant's needs extended beyond an immediate or recurrent health problem to future-oriented needs, as vulnerable people presented to the ED seeking support to change their life circumstances. When responding to these claims as custodians, doctors and nurses experienced a high level of tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and the ED's finite resources as a local Uses minimum resources if patient is safe to leave: ''We're not going to hold them here against their will unless there is reason to, i.e., they're a threat of harming themselves or others.''

A team of six people-Dr S, a junior doctor, social workers, and community services-spend the entire day organizing a hospital admission, home support, and removal of driver's license. For the two ED doctors, the intervention to keep ''the most extraordinary complicated social circumstance from advancing to complete disaster'' dominates everything else going on in the ED, where other doctors and nurses work as best they can to cover for their absence. Dr S, who stays to resolve some issues for an extra two hours after the end of shift, describes how P's family ''went home just sobbing because someone had made an effort to try and sort it out.'' Emphasizing ''the emergency department was a great site for it to happen,'' Dr S adds, ''But it took a huge amount of work. That's a lot of health resource.'' Dr S tells the junior doctor, ''That's probably the greatest intervention you'll achieve as a junior in an emergency department. Much more so than fixing a broken arm. . . . This is far more important to have achieved.'' (Fieldnotes, D20) This example illustrates the microprocesses through which custodians reconcile a high level of tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and local resources. The senior doctor judged the basis for the person's claim as a need involving social justice and human welfare. This need aroused intense moral emotions, with the doctor deeply concerned for the patient and family and motivated to activate extraordinary resources to accomplish the highest values of the ED as a place of social inclusion. Rather than the ED's finite supply of resources constraining the claim response, the doctor instead enacted his role as custodian by interpreting local resources (bed, staff time, social workers' knowledge, community services) as enablers of a more enduring intervention for the family's welfare. Table 3 presents other examples of custodians evaluating claims as human needs that exceed ordinary resource allocations, experiencing high tension between inclusion and resources, feeling intense moral emotions, and activating resources as enablers. Examples include claims by victims of domestic violence and by other vulnerable people judged to be in crisis and in need of ''community services to help support them'' (N12). Claims can also trigger resource-enabling responses when custodians judge a person with an addiction as sincerely wanting help to ''change in their trajectory'' (D3). Finally, claims for end-of-life care prompt resource enabling when the ED provides extraordinary resources to honor human dignity at the end of life. For custodians, the human needs underpinning these types of claims arouse intense moral emotions of empathic concern: ''If you're not upset by grief . . . or a tragic story, you need to go and get another job'' (N1). Some claims aroused moral emotions of such intensity that ''there are ones that will live with me forever'' (D8). Our data suggest that these processes of resource-enabling work are distinctive to custodianship of public EDs. Reflecting on their experiences being employed in both public and private EDs, several research participants explained that there is no ''na\u00efve separation'' (D16) between acute medicine and social disadvantage in the fieldsite ED, as opposed to in a private ED. Some participants asserted that other specialist departments in the public hospital could also separate social disadvantage from medicine to some extent because the ED provided a buffer as ''the first port of call'' (R3, R4) between community and hospital. Resource-enabling work allowed custodians to uphold the highest ideals of a public ED as a place of social inclusion for the most needy citizens: ''rightly, the community should expect more from us'' (D37). While it was easier for custodians to allocate more resources to these types of claims when the ED was not overloaded, custodians tried to keep focused on ''making the right decision [about the person's resource needs] each time . . . even if the place is heaving'' (D39). As our field observations demonstrate, if resource-enabling work is ''the best we can do [for a person's needs], we run around like crazy trying to achieve that'' (N23).",

Second, they managed the inclusion-resource tension at the local place by ensuring that the ED remained open. Because ''the reality is we don't really have a lot of control about who comes through or how many people come through the front doors'' (R7), there is potential for the volume of claims to completely overwhelm the ED resources available at the local place.

Persons with blood-borne viruses (e.g., hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus/HIV) and diseases transmitted via droplets (e.g., influenza, whooping cough) and/or airborne routes (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) posed the highest risk of infection for doctors and nurses. Custodians classified infectious diseases that had a well-understood and familiar disease process as known risks. For example, doctors and nurses ''understand the flu a bit more and have had experience with it'' (D16), occasionally treat cases of measles and tuberculosis (fieldnotes), and ''could get a needle stick every day from a HIV patient or a hep-C patient . . . we've got used to those risks'' (D11). Familiar infectious diseases had evidence-based risk mitigation procedures that doctors and nurses trusted, such as infection control precautions, personal protective equipment, warning signs, quarantines, and staff immunization. Because they ''knew how to deal with infectious diseases that came to the front door'' (D4), custodians could resolve the inclusion-safety tension when responding to claims: If these patients come here seeking help, you see them and you assess them properly [while mitigating the known risk of harm], and then you make sure that they're okay and you activate the resources needed for them. . . . I'm nervous about it when you walk in to see someone who's angry and snarling and spitting, where you've got a much greater risk of actually getting a transmissible disease. But you do what you have to do. . . . Are you going to refuse to see them because your chance of getting harmed is much higher? Of course not. (D13) As the example above illustrates, when doctors and nurses classify a person making a claim as a known risk, they perceive tension between the safety of the local place and social inclusion. Despite feeling ''slightly excited and scared about what's coming up'' (N2), they are able to manage their fear sufficiently to perform their role as custodians by mitigating risk and then activating resources to meet the human need underlying the claim. The above example also illuminates how managing fear is bolstered by custodians' moral emotions related to a sense of concern for doing the ''right thing'' to meet the needs of the patient and society more broadly. A nurse, who had recently been cut with a knife when responding to a claim by a suicidal patient, explained: ''My Achilles heel in those situations is trying to help the patient, so I'll put myself in a bit more danger'' (N24).",

Our fieldnotes show that moral emotions associated with not wanting to violate their custodian responsibilities to the community (''the nursing home can't cope'') and empathy for the patient (''it's quite sad'') helped subdue fear. The treating team resolved the inclusion-safety tension by mitigating the known risk through sedation, which allowed them to safely keep the patient in the ED overnight until specialist services could provide support the next day. Table 4 presents other examples in which custodians classify a claim as a known risk, experience low inclusion-safety tension and manageable fear, and are motivated to take action by mitigating the harm and then rationing or enabling resources to meet the person's need.

Thus our fieldsite ED became the local place that public health authorities, who monitored arrivals from West Africa and imposed home quarantines, would send suspected cases of Ebola for assessment.

The first category evaluated Ebola claims as a special risk. While acknowledging that Australia's border protection protocols would likely prevent a person in the highly infectious ''wet stage'' of the virus from reaching the local place, doctors and nurses in this category noticed cues from multiple information streams that two nurses in the U.S. had become infected and bracketed these cues as important. A doctor explained, ''If those two nurses hadn't caught it, I think [the perceived risk of Ebola] would be totally different'' (D16). These cues focused sensemaking attention on differences between Ebola and more familiar threats. Ebola's high transmission risk, incurability, and high mortality rate were interpreted as a different sort of risk from that posed by violence and other infectious diseases. Ascribing significance to these differences produced the evaluation that claims by persons with Ebola represented a ''special'' risk.",

Others noted that it was ''disappointing'' (D24) and ''embarrassing . . . for people to say we're not here for this. Aren't we? I'm pretty sure we are'' (D14). Individuals contemplating the violation of their custodian responsibilities by not responding universally to Ebola claims wrestled with both fear and selfconscious moral emotions like shame: I don't even know if I'd be walking in there [to treat a person who might have Ebola], but by the same token that's not the way we're built in the public ED. We can't say, ''Come here if you're sick and we'll see you and we'll sort you out unless you've got Ebola.'' . . . And I think that's what's caused that real level of angst, and it's challenged the way you perceive yourself [as a custodian] much more so than anything else. (D11) These emotional contests over custodianship of Ebola claims came to a head at a meeting of senior ED doctors, a member of the hospital executive team, and the Infectious Diseases Department. The ED director organized the meeting to ''let people vent their spleen'' in a facilitated forum about how the local place should respond to Ebola claims (fieldnotes). ED doctors used the meeting as a ''useful tool . . . for having those fierce conversations'' (D20) about their differing views of Ebola risk and custodianship. The meeting was emotionally charged. Doctors expressed ''forcefulness of opinions . . . that showed how diverse views are'' (D18).",

First, the ED as a place of social inclusion was constituted by the salient attributes of persons making claims. If a person was acutely sick and undiagnosed with an illness, ''then absolutely the ED's the right place for them'' (N20). Second, the ED's societal-level meaning as a place of social inclusion was constituted by local responses to claims that upheld ''the general principles of people having equal access'' (D1). Custodians agreed ''the role of a public ED . . . is to treat everyone exactly the same'' (N14).

Our model shows how the institution of a place of social inclusion can be maintained through microprocesses of custodianship at the local level. Every time a citizen exercises their right to universal access and presents at a local place of social inclusion to make a claim for services, custodians have a responsibility to respond. Custodians are also deeply committed to the institution's values of social inclusion. When a custodian perceives tensions between the institutional value of social inclusion and the local place's ability to actualize the value, these tensions elicit emotions and motivate multiple forms of custodian work that maintain the local place of social inclusion.",

In contrast, when custodians evaluate a claim as carrying an unknown risk, the inclusion-safety tension arouses fear that is difficult for custodians to control and motivates a desire to keep the local place safe through harm-avoiding work. Because failing to respond to a claim deviates from a custodian's responsibilities and value commitments to upholding universal access, moral emotions are also elicited. If moral emotions reduce fear to a manageable level, custodians find ways to mitigate harm and protect universal access at the local place, thereby maintaining the institution of a place of social inclusion at the societal level.

            "text": "We bring together the literatures in humanistic geography, sociology, and institutional theory in organization studies and make a significant contribution by proposing a place of social inclusion as a special type of institution. Our concept of a place of social inclusion is anchored in scholarship about public places of democracy that are accessible to all citizens (Altman and Zube, 1989; Carr et al., 1992) , local places that are geographically bounded, material, and meaningful (Tuan, 1977; Gieryn, 2000) , and societal institutions as nested multi-level systems (Scott, 2014) . Although the possibility that places of social inclusion exist can be inferred from these previous writings, their distinctive characteristics have not been conceptualized and integrated into theoretical understandings of institutions until now. The literature pointed us to the initial definition of a place of social inclusion that we sketched at the beginning of this paper. Our empirical study of a public hospital emergency department now allows us to deepen and elaborate our understanding of the defining societallevel and local-level characteristics of a place of social inclusion as an institution. We contend that places of social inclusion are distinguished as institutions by the following characteristics: (1) establishment at the level of society to accomplish values of social inclusion by providing citizens with universal access to services for essential human needs; and (2) endowment of geographic sites at the local level with material resources, meaning, and values as places where citizens in need can make claims. A consequence of these two defining characteristics is the associated value tensions between universal accessibility and the finite resources and safety of the local place. We suggest that our theoretical model of how these tensions create conditions for custodianship may be generalizable beyond public emergency departments to other places of social inclusion. To illustrate, we offer an example of the model's application to public schools, which are ''pervasive institutions'' in society and local communities (Longhofer, Negro, and Roberts, 2019: 223) . While the ''egalitarian ethos'' of education-for-all exists at the societal level (Domina, Penner, and Penner, 2017: 311) , students live in neighborhoods with particular demographic, economic, and racial characteristics and make claims for access to education at their local public school (Arum, 2000; Longhofer, Negro, and Roberts, 2019) . Principals and teachers in local public schools at times perceive tension between the societallevel value of universal access and the resources available to meet student needs at their particular school, such as classrooms, staff, technology, and equipment (Arum, 2000) . Our model suggests this value tension motivates some of them to act as local custodians by rationing resources to meet students' ordinary needs and enabling resources for vulnerable and/or gifted students. We do not assert that these custodian judgments will always or necessarily accomplish the highest values of social inclusion in terms of social justice and human empowerment. On the contrary, our model contends that whether a student's claim for education at a neighborhood public school elicits resource-rationing work or resource-enabling work depends on the subjective judgments and moral emotions of local custodians.",

Safety threats can arise from the spread of infectious diseases like measles (Rowan, 1982) when claims for access are made by unvaccinated students posing risks of harm at local schools with insufficient herd immunity (Becker et al., 2016) . Our model explains how government administrators and principals of local schools respond to this inclusion-safety tension through harm-mitigating work, including reviewing students' vaccination records, canceling extracurricular activities, and quarantining infected students (Pingali et al., 2019) . In an extreme crisis, our model shows how fear of spreading an infectious disease can outweigh moral emotions of denying students access to education. For instance, in the wake of two recent measles outbreaks, custodians of schools in Clark County, Washington in the U.S. excluded unvaccinated students for several weeks (McRae, 2019) . In addition, claims at local schools may pose threats of harm through violence (Lee, 2013) , recognized as a problem of ''persistence and pervasiveness throughout the history of education'' (Cornell and Mayer, 2010: 7) . School counselors, teachers, and administrators play roles as custodians through harm-mitigating work, including monitoring students' communications and behavior and referring them for mental health support (Paolini, 2015) . When fears escalate in the aftermath of a gun shooting (Newman, 2005) , however, our model suggests that custodianship regarding the value of social inclusion may start to break down. Harm-avoiding proposals-such as arming teachers with guns or zerotolerance policies that expel students for minor disciplinary infractions (Skiba and Knesting, 2001 )-may emerge, disrupting the values of the public school as an accessible and safe place of social inclusion. As with Ebola in our study, disruptions from shootings and measles outbreaks represent extreme cases. More commonly, custodianship through resource-rationing, resource-enabling, and harm-mitigating work will maintain the local public school as a place of social inclusion.",

Various other places of social inclusion established at institutional levels and instantiated at local levels warrant empirical investigation. Courts of law in democratic societies, for example, are charged with delivering impartial justice to all citizens (Parkinson, 2012) , and local courthouses constitute the places where citizens come to access this legal justice (McPherson and Sauder, 2013) . Public libraries and museums in towns and cities provide citizens with universal access to information, collective memory, and cultural heritage (Nelson and Irwin, 2015) . The two defining characteristics of places of social inclusion could also apply to government sites offering employment services, public housing, community centers, social welfare agencies, and parks and recreation facilities (Altman and Zube, 1989) . These places ''protect the rights of user groups and are accessible to all groups'' when citizens make claims at the local level for basic human needs (Carr et al., 1992: 19) . Finally, places that are ''physical sites of democratic performance'' (Parkinson, 2012 : 1), such as legislative assembly buildings, seem to fit the characteristics of a place of social inclusion when they remain open so that collective decision making is accessible and visible to citizens. While our main contribution is to shine light on places of social inclusion as a special type of institution, our study also contributes to the literatures on place and institutions, custodianship, and the role of emotions in institutional work.",

An implicit assumption is that these are places of professional work inside public-sector organizations. Our findings challenge this assumption because typifications of profession and organization are inadequate for capturing how societal-level values inhere in places at the local level. Framing geographic sites narrowly as places of professional work avoids attention to the higher level of social purpose that some of these places are mandated to fulfill in democratic society (Selznick, 1992) . Viewing these places as public-sector organizations prioritizes questions associated with organizational goals and management processes (Kraatz, Ventresca, and Deng, 2010) , overlooking citizens' expectations and lived experience of them not as organizations but as local places to which they are entitled access. Conjoining profession with public organization disregards the tensions between social inclusion and local resources and safety that make places of social inclusion precarious.",

This puzzle asks ''can a social purpose that is fundamentally experiential be institutionalized at all?'' (Nilsson, 2015: 370) and leads to contradictions such as ''how schools can at once be egalitarian institutions and agents of inequality'' (Domina, Penner, and Penner, 2017: 311) . In contrast to customary explanations anchored in professional, administrative, and organizational failure (Rowan, 1982; Raudenbush and Eschmann, 2015) , our findings suggest these contradictions are related to the constitution of places of social inclusion as nested societal and local institutions. Whether an egalitarian institution at the societal level functions as an agent of equality or inequality at the local level depends on the volume and nature of claim-makers at a local place; it also depends on the subjective judgments of claimresponders with regard to tensions between universal access and the finite resources and safety of the local place. By revealing how the institutional dynamics of ''claim making'' and ''responding to claims'' are tailored to local places, our model gives researchers and policymakers a new piece of the puzzle of ''experienced inequality'' (Selznick, 1992: 383) , which was obscured when places of social inclusion were viewed through other theoretical lenses.",

Institutional complexity is likely to manifest differently when professionals work in these special places (Greenwood et al., 2011) . Our findings intimate, for example, that some of the public defenders in McPherson and Sauder's (2013) study of a drug court may have been more willing to stray from their home professional logic and strategically hijack other logics because they identified as custodians of a place of social justice and were engaged in custodianship to manage resource and safety tensions. Thus our model contributes place-based insights that may help to clarify and refine theories of how professionals function as institutional agents. In a different vein, our study offers a theoretical avenue for reconciling conflicting results about the ''paradox of expertise'' when new technology emerges in professional work (Lewis, 2000) . Notably, librarians in public libraries ignored the Internet as predicted by the paradox of expertise (Nelson and Irwin, 2015) , while curators in public museums embraced it (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018) . Museum curators linked ''the emerging technology of the Internet and the principle of providing universal access to their collection'' (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018: 1773) , implying they responded to the Internet as custodians of a place of social inclusion whereas librarians responded as professionals. Custodian identity for librarians became activated later, when free access to online information created safety threats in local libraries by exposing children to inappropriate or offensive material (Jaeger et al., 2012) . The theoretical insights from our study hint that custodianship of universal access may moderate the paradox of expertise.",

These were clearly present in our study of a public hospital emergency department. What our findings unmask is a distinctive type of custodian work associated with a place of social inclusion that complements existing accounts offered by scholars of professions and public administration. This raises an obvious question. If public emergency departments, for example, are both places of medicine for professionals administered by public-sector organizations and places of social inclusion for society, how can researchers separate the institutional work directed at these different institutions? Our findings show that doctors and nurses working in a public ED where all citizens could receive services distinguished their professional work from that performed in private ED settings where only patients able to pay received treatment. They explained that their professional work as doctors and nurses was similar in both settings, but that in a public ED they were also engaged in custodian work to manage value tensions associated with universal access. This custodianship of the place of social inclusion was extra work overlaid on top of the normal work of patient diagnosis, care, and treatment required in a place of acute medicine. Thus, in conceptualizing places of social inclusion, we do not theorize that all work carried out is custodian work. What differentiates custodianship is its activation through perceived value tensions between the societallevel value of social inclusion and the local place.",

We extend prior research that shows moral emotions play a role in institutional work by illuminating when and how they can activate custodian work that protects an institution's values. Moral emotions are feelings that are prosocial and motivate action tendencies for the interests of others (Haidt, 2003; Tangney, Stuewig, and Mashek, 2007) . Previous studies have focused attention on how moral emotions-including empathy for others, pride in moral rightness, and shame at moral wrongs-motivate institutional work to create, maintain, and change institutions (Moisander, Hirsto, and Fahy, 2016; Fan and Zietsma, 2017; Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017) . Adding to this growing line of research, our study highlights how moral emotions motivate custodian work when actors care deeply about the values of an institution and perceive tension between those values and their accomplishment in local places. Moreover, our findings reveal that embedded actors can feel emotional attachment to both institutions and local places. Thus we speculate that the intensity of moral emotions may be stronger when institutional work is targeted at maintaining institutions that are constituted as places, although future research is needed to explore this possibility.",

First, an institution's regulations, norms, and systemic power arouse fear among institutional actors, which disciplines them to conform (Marti and Fernandez, 2013; Gill and Burrow, 2018) . Second, institutional actors may use fear as a motivational force to collectively create, maintain, and change institutions (Moisander, Hirsto, and Fahy, 2016; Wijaya and Heugens, 2018) . Both explanations are rooted in a socialized understanding of fear as being experienced in the context of institutions (Voronov and Vince, 2012) . In contrast, our study of Ebola in a public emergency department reveals the potential for an alternative understanding in which fear is less directly connected to a person's socialization within an institution and operates at a more basic level. This conceptualization resonates with the psychology literature on basic emotions, in which fear is an immediate intuitive reaction to a stimulus that triggers human behavior for survival (Ekman, 1992 (Ekman, , 1999 . Custodians' initial fears about the Ebola virus were basic emotions, and the immediate instinct was self-defense to avoid personal harm. This distinction between fear as a socialized and basic emotion is not trivial. Whereas prior research has shown that socialized fear is an important and relatively straightforward mechanism in institutional maintenance (Creed et al., 2014; Gill and Burrow, 2018) , our study reveals that institutional processes are more complicated when institutional actors feel fear as a basic emotion.",

In our study, moral emotions that were endogenously embedded in the institution of a place of social inclusion-including empathy for the needs of institutional participants and embarrassment at the possibility of failing to uphold the institution's values-rose up to play off against fear triggered exogenously as a basic emotion by the environmental jolt of the Ebola outbreak. Through their self-consciously evaluative nature, moral emotions helped to dampen fear to the degree that custodians were able to fight against their own basic instincts for self-preservation and engage in institutional work to maintain the institution. A comparable interplay of moral emotions and basic emotions appears to have normalized fears associated with custodian work in response to familiar infectious diseases and patient violence. Thus our model extends prior research on moral emotions by illuminating their critical role in moderating fear, which otherwise has the potential to derail institutional maintenance. We speculate that if a patient suffering from Ebola or behaving violently caused serious harm or death to others, basic emotions might overwhelm more reflective moral emotions and disrupt ordinary processes of institutional maintenance. We call for further research exploring the dynamics of fear and institutional disruption, which events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic suggest is an issue of vital global importance for places of social inclusion.",

            "text": "Interplay between basic and moral emotions in the unfolding processes of institutional work over time is a unique aspect of our study. Prior empirical studies have tended to ignore basic emotions, possibly because they seem \u00e0 priori to be less theoretically salient to institutions than socialized emotions. The study of emotions in institutions has also been hampered by methodological difficulties of tracing institutional actors' emotions in real time (Goodrick, Jarvis, and Reay, 2019). Our study benefitted methodologically when an unexpected environmental jolt (Meyer, 1982) during our fieldwork cast the basic emotion of fear into sharp relief. Thus it is hardly surprising that the relationships between basic and moral emotions and institutional work revealed in our study have been largely hidden until now. We conjecture that these relationships are generalizable to other institutions beyond places of social inclusion. We suspect, for example, that institutional work to create Canada's first safe narcotics injection sites in Lawrence's (2017) study and institutional work to disrupt organized crime in Sicily in Vaccaro and Palazzo's (2015) study were both enabled by moral emotions controlling institutional actors' basic emotions of fear. In addition to exploring the experience of fear in other types of institutions, we invite investigation of other basic emotions identified in the psychology literature, including anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise (Ekman, 1992 (Ekman, , 1999 . Future research into institutional work could explore when and how instinctive basic emotions work with and against higher-order reflective emotions that are more closely connected with actors' socialization and embeddedness within institutions, such as moral anger and betrayal (Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wijaya and Heugens, 2018) , shame (Creed et. al., 2014) , other-suffering empathy (Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017) , and pride (Fan and Zietsma, 2017) .",

We offer insight into how these institutions are maintained across nested societal and local levels through the purposeful work of custodians. We invite research exploring custodianship in diverse places of social inclusion, ranging from places with venerable histories of inclusion like public schools and museums to recently emerging places like sanctuary cities. Our findings about how such places endure are timely in light of the overwhelming fear and disruptions to places of social inclusion in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic and given contested political discourse in the U.S. and Europe about what it means for nations, cities, and communities to be socially inclusive places. We encourage scholars to explore places of social inclusion and to expand the theorization and empirical investigation of place and institutions.",

You've got something that carries a high death rate, you can't stop it, and it seems like it's contagious. . . . It creates a huge amount of fear.'' (D21) A resident R and two nurses assess patient P who presented with flu-like symptoms.After blood samples are taken, P casually mentions that P's spouse had recently returned from holidaying in Africa. N gasps. ''You needed to report that information to the nurse at the Triage desk.'' Swearing, R races to the Triage zone to check the list of countries known to be infected with Ebola and is relieved to learn that P's spouse had not been in an Ebola-infected area. Sharing the story with a group of doctors and nurses on the next shift, R recalls, ''I have never been so scared in my life.'' (Fieldnotes) It's our job to see people that are sick that come through the door. . . . I can understand the fear [of becoming infected with Ebola], but that same doctor would be quite happy to walk up to someone who is off his head on drugs, holding a knife. . . . You expose yourself to much greater risk every single day.'' (D14) ''[Assessing patients] is what we are here to do. . . . If [Ebola] came through the door,it came through the door.'' (N24) Nurse N is frustrated that not all staff see the need for Ebola training. ''They don't seem to get it. We're an emergency department, and everyone has to be prepared to safely assess these patients if they turn up. We all had to see swine flu patients.",
